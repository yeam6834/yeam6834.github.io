<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is a role model. Someome who you look up to. To me, an essential quality of a hero is someone who can get the best out of the people around him. In many ways Gordie Howe is the defintion of a hero. He is a pioneer in the game of hockey and is considering one of the best players of all time.</p>
<p>Through his determination and perserverance he inspires me and many others to keep pushing and striving for our dreams. His accountability, toughness and pure talent was a driving force behind his team, where he influenced and pushed his teammates like no one else can. </p>
